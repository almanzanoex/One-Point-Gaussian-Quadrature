# One-Point-Gaussian-Quadrature
This MATLAB script demonstrates how time effective the One Point Gaussian Quadrature is relative to analytical integration. It also demonstrates how the error is dependent on the domain size.

The function being integrated is a quadratic equation in the following form.
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
